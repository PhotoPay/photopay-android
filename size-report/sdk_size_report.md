## PhotoPay SDK size report

This SDK size report is for all supported ABIs. We use the Android official [**apkanalyzer**](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apkanalyzer) command line tool to calculate the sizes.

**NOTE**: Presented APK sizes are sums of the `base APK size` + the `size of our SDK`. Roughly, the `base APK size` is about `1MB`, which means that APK size increase caused by our SDK in your application will be approximately `1MB` less than presented.

| ABI | APK file size | APK download size |

| armeabi-v7a | 24MB | 19.6MB |
| arm64-v8a | 25.8MB | 20.1MB |
| x86 | 29.1MB | 21.2MB |
